Project Recommendations:
To further enhance the dashboard and extract more valuable insights, consider the following recommendations:
 * Drill-Down Functionality: Implement drill-down features to allow users to explore data at a more granular level (e.g., by product, customer, or time period).
 * Comparative Analysis: Include benchmarks or industry averages to compare the company's performance against external standards.
 * Predictive Analytics: Incorporate predictive models to forecast future sales trends and identify potential opportunities or risks.
 * User Customization: Provide options for users to customize the dashboard to their specific needs and preferences.
 * Data Integration: Integrate data from other relevant sources (e.g., marketing, customer service) to gain a more holistic view of the business.
By implementing these recommendations, the sales dashboard can become a more powerful tool for driving business growth and making informed decisions.
